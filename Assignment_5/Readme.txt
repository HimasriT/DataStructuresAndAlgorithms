1) Used Visual Studio editor.
2) Build the code file.
3) Run the program.-> a) Enter the choice for the graph to be executed
		   -> b) Choice 1: For graph1 , 2: For graph2, 3: For user defined graph
		   -> c) If choice 1 is choosen, it gives the result of the topological sort ordering.
		   -> d) First, it displays the BFS topological ordering of the graph.
		   -> e) Next, it displays the DFS topological ordering of the graph.
		   -> f) It displays whether the circle is present in the graph or not.
		   -> g) If choice 2 is choosen, it gives the result of the topological sort ordering.
		   -> h) If choice 3 is choosen, user needs to give the graph input.
		   -> i) Enter the number of nodes
		   -> j) Enter the number of edges.
		   -> k) Enter the directed edge in the form of a b ( a -> b)
		   -> l) After entering all the edges, it prints the adjacency list representation of graph.
		   -> m) It displays the BFS and DFS topological ordering of graph.

Screenshots are attached in Assignment_5 file.
The visual representation of the graph also attached.
