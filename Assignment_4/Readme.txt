1) Used Visual Studio editor.
2) Build the code file.
3) Run the program.-> a) Enter the number of nodes
		   -> b) Enter the number of edges.
		   -> c) Enter the directed edge in the form of a b ( a -> b)
		   -> d) After entering all the edges, it prints the adjacency list representation of graph.
		   -> e) Program calls DFS traversal and prints all the vertices in the visited order
		   -> f) Program calls BFS traversal and prints all the vertices.
Screenshots are attached in Assignment_4 file.
The visual representation of the graph also attached.
